## SubStatz accessibility best practices

- **ShadCN UI Accessibility**: Leverage ShadCN UI's built-in accessibility features and ARIA attributes
- **Form Accessibility**: Ensure all subscription and authentication forms have proper labels and error messaging
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Make subscription management (add, edit, delete) fully keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: Test subscription dashboard and forms with screen readers
- **Color and Contrast**: Use ShadCN UI's color system for proper contrast ratios; don't rely on color alone for subscription status
- **Focus Management**: Implement proper focus management for modals, forms, and dynamic content
- **Semantic Structure**: Use proper heading hierarchy for subscription lists and dashboard sections
- **Alternative Text**: Provide meaningful alt text for subscription icons and images
- **Error Messages**: Ensure form validation errors are announced to screen readers
- **Loading States**: Make loading states accessible with proper ARIA live regions
- **Interactive Elements**: Ensure all subscription actions (buttons, links) are properly labeled and accessible
