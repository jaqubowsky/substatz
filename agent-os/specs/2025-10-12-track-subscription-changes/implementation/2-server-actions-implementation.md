# Task 2: Server Actions

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** server-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
This task involved creating and modifying the server actions required to manage subscription history, including logging changes and providing CRUD operations for history records.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation focused on two main areas: extending the existing subscription update logic to automatically log changes, and creating a new set of server actions to manage the history records themselves.

First, the `updateSubscriptionAction` was refactored to use a dedicated, type-safe utility function, `trackSubscriptionChanges`. This function, located in `src/features/dashboard/lib/history.ts`, is responsible for comparing the original and updated subscription data and creating `SubscriptionHistory` records for any detected changes. This abstraction cleans up the server action and centralizes the change-tracking logic.

Second, a new file was created at `src/features/dashboard/server/actions/subscription-history.ts` to house the server actions dedicated to managing the history records. This includes actions for getting, updating, and deleting history entries. The validation schema for these actions was also separated into its own file at `src/features/dashboard/schemas/subscription-history.ts` to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `src/features/dashboard/server/actions/subscription-history.ts` - Contains the new server actions for getting, updating, and deleting subscription history records.
- `src/features/dashboard/lib/history.ts` - Contains the `trackSubscriptionChanges` utility function for logging subscription updates.
- `src/features/dashboard/schemas/subscription-history.ts` - Contains the Zod schema for validating subscription history updates.

### Modified Files
- `src/features/dashboard/server/actions/subscription.ts` - Refactored the `updateSubscriptionAction` to use the `trackSubscriptionChanges` utility.
- `src/features/dashboard/server/db/subscription.ts` - Added new database functions (`getSubscriptionHistory`, `updateSubscriptionHistory`, `deleteSubscriptionHistory`) to interact with the `SubscriptionHistory` table.

## Key Implementation Details

### `trackSubscriptionChanges` Utility
**Location:** `src/features/dashboard/lib/history.ts`

This new, type-safe function is the core of the change-logging mechanism. It takes the original subscription and the updated data as arguments, iterates through a predefined list of trackable keys, and identifies any differences. For each change, it prepares a `SubscriptionHistory` record and then creates all records in a single batch transaction using `prisma.subscriptionHistory.createMany()`.

**Rationale:** Extracting this logic into a utility function makes the `updateSubscriptionAction` simpler and more focused. It also makes the change-tracking logic easier to test and reuse elsewhere if needed, while improving type safety.

### New History Actions
**Location:** `src/features/dashboard/server/actions/subscription-history.ts`

Three new safe actions were created for CRUD operations on history records, with their validation schema moved to a separate file.

**Rationale:** Creating a separate file for these actions and their schema follows the feature-based folder structure and the Single Responsibility Principle, making the logic easy to find and maintain.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### product/tech-stack.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation uses Next.js Server Actions and Zod for schema validation, which are the prescribed technologies in the tech stack for handling mutations and data validation.

### product/folder-structure.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/folder-structure.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The new actions, schemas, and utility files were placed in their respective directories (`actions`, `schemas`, `lib`) within the `src/features/dashboard/` directory, adhering to the project's feature-based folder structure.

### global/validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All new server actions use Zod schemas, now located in a dedicated schema file, to validate their input, ensuring that all data mutations are type-safe.

### global/error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The `updateSubscriptionAction` continues to check for the existence of the subscription before attempting an update and throws an `ActionError` if it's not found, aligning with the project's error handling strategy.

### global/conventions.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The refactoring promotes modularity and the Single Responsibility Principle by separating the change-tracking logic into a utility function and the validation schema into its own file.
