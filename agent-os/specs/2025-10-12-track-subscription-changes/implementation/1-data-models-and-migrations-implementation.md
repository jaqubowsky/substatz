# Task 1: Data Models and Migrations

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
This task involved creating the database schema and migration for the `SubscriptionHistory` feature.

## Implementation Summary
The primary goal was to establish the database foundation for tracking changes to subscriptions. This was achieved by introducing a new `SubscriptionHistory` model in the Prisma schema. This model is designed to capture individual changes to a subscription, storing the field that was changed, its old value, and its new value.

A one-to-many relationship was established between the `Subscription` and `SubscriptionHistory` models. The `onDelete: Cascade` rule was included to ensure that if a subscription is deleted, all of its associated history records are also automatically deleted, maintaining data integrity. After updating the schema, a Prisma migration was generated and successfully applied to sync the database with the new model.

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added the `SubscriptionHistory` model and established its relationship with the `Subscription` model.

### New Files
- `prisma/migrations/20251012142721_add_subscription_history/migration.sql` - The migration file generated by Prisma to create the `SubscriptionHistory` table and its foreign key constraints.

## Key Implementation Details

### `SubscriptionHistory` Model
**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

A new model, `SubscriptionHistory`, was added with the following fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier (CUID).
- `createdAt`: A timestamp for when the history record was created.
- `changedField`: A `String` to store the name of the subscription field that was modified (e.g., "price").
- `oldValue`: A `String` to store the value of the field before the change.
- `newValue`: A `String` to store the value of the field after the change.
- `subscriptionId`: A foreign key to link to the `Subscription` model.
- `subscription`: The relation to the `Subscription` model. An index was added to `subscriptionId` to optimize queries.

**Rationale:** This structure provides a flexible and scalable way to log changes to any field on the `Subscription` model without needing to alter the schema for each new field we want to track. Storing old and new values as strings is a simple, universal approach.

## Database Changes

### Migrations
- `20251012142721_add_subscription_history/migration.sql` - Creates the `SubscriptionHistory` table.
  - Added tables: `SubscriptionHistory`
  - Added columns: `id`, `createdAt`, `changedField`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, `subscriptionId`
  - Added indexes: An index on the `subscriptionId` column.
  - Foreign keys: A foreign key constraint from `SubscriptionHistory.subscriptionId` to `Subscription.id`.

### Schema Impact
The database schema was updated non-destructively by adding a new table. There is no impact on existing data.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### product/tech-stack.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation uses Prisma ORM and Prisma Migrate, which are the established technologies for database management in the project's tech stack.

### product/folder-structure.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/folder-structure.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All schema changes were made in `prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations were generated into the `prisma/migrations` directory, adhering to the project's folder structure for database-related files.

### global/validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
While this task did not involve business logic validation, the use of Prisma's type safety and relational integrity (foreign keys) ensures a base level of data validation at the database layer.

### global/error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
This task was focused on the database schema and did not involve procedural error handling. The migration process itself has built-in error handling provided by Prisma.
