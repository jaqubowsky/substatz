# Task 3: UI Implementation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** frontend-engineer

**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
This task involved creating the frontend components to view, edit, and delete subscription history.

## Implementation Summary
The UI implementation for the subscription history feature was broken down into three main components to ensure modularity and reusability, following the project's standards for composable, single-responsibility components.

First, `SubscriptionHistoryCard.tsx` was created to display a single history entry. It's a client component that receives a history object and callbacks for edit and delete actions, encapsulating the presentation of one record.

Second, `SubscriptionHistoryEditForm.tsx` was built to handle the editing of a history record. It uses `react-hook-form` and a Zod schema for robust, type-safe form management, and it invokes the corresponding server action to persist changes, providing a seamless editing experience.

Third, `SubscriptionHistoryView.tsx` acts as the orchestrator. It's a dialog-based component that fetches the history for a given subscription, displays the records using `SubscriptionHistoryCard`, and manages the state for both the main history view and the secondary edit dialog. This component handles all the client-side logic, such as data fetching, state management for loading and transitions, and invoking the edit and delete server actions.

Finally, the feature was integrated into the existing UI by modifying `SubscriptionCardActions.tsx` to include a "History" button in the dropdown menu, which triggers the `SubscriptionHistoryView` dialog. This approach ensures the new feature feels like a natural part of the existing user flow.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/subscription-history-card.tsx` - Displays a single subscription history record with edit and delete buttons.
- `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/subscription-history-edit-form.tsx` - A form for editing a history record.
- `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/subscription-history-view.tsx` - A dialog component that fetches and displays the history for a subscription.

### Modified Files
- `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/subscription-card-actions.tsx` - Added a "History" menu item to the dropdown to trigger the history view dialog.

## Key Implementation Details

### `SubscriptionHistoryView` Component
**Location:** `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/subscription-history-view.tsx`

This is the main component for the feature. It is composed of two dialogs: one to display the list of history items and another to host the edit form. It fetches data on open, manages loading states, and provides callbacks to the `SubscriptionHistoryCard` for edit and delete actions. This separation keeps the main view clean while providing a clear entry point for the edit functionality.

**Rationale:** Using separate dialogs for viewing the list and editing an entry simplifies state management. The main view only needs to know when to open the edit dialog, and the edit dialog is self-contained, handling its own form logic and submission. This aligns with the SRP and keeps the components decoupled.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### product/tech-stack.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation uses React Server and Client Components, Next.js, ShadCN UI for components (like `Dialog`, `Card`, `Button`), `react-hook-form` for form management, and `sonner` for toast notifications, all of which are part of the established tech stack.

### product/folder-structure.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/folder-structure.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All new components were created within the `src/features/dashboard/components/subscription-details/` directory, which is consistent with the project's feature-based folder structure.

### frontend/components.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The new components are small, focused, and composable. For example, `SubscriptionHistoryCard` handles the presentation of a single item, and `SubscriptionHistoryView` composes these cards into a list, following the principle of building complex UI from smaller, reusable pieces.

### frontend/css.md & frontend/responsive.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The components leverage the existing TailwindCSS classes and ShadCN UI component styles, ensuring visual consistency without adding custom CSS. The dialogs and cards are inherently responsive.

### frontend/accessibility.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
By using the ShadCN UI `Dialog` and `Form` components, which are built on top of accessible primitives like Radix UI, the implementation inherits a high level of accessibility for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
