We're continuing our implementation of Track Subscription Changes by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 3: UI Implementation
**Assigned implementer:** `frontend-engineer`
**Dependencies:** Task Group 2

- [ ] 3.0 Complete UI components
  - [ ] 3.1 Create a new `SubscriptionHistoryView.tsx` component that will act as a dialog/modal.
  - [ ] 3.2 This component should call the `getSubscriptionHistory` server action to fetch and display the history records in a chronological list or timeline format.
  - [ ] 3.3 Create a `SubscriptionHistoryCard.tsx` component to render the details of a single history entry.
  - [ ] 3.4 Add "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to each `SubscriptionHistoryCard`. The "Delete" button should trigger the `deleteSubscriptionHistory` action (ideally with a confirmation dialog). The "Edit" button should open a form to modify the entry.
  - [ ] 3.5 Add a "View History" button to the `SubscriptionCardActions.tsx` component, which will open the `SubscriptionHistoryView` dialog.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The "View History" button correctly opens the history modal.
- The history modal correctly fetches and displays all history records for the subscription.
- Users can successfully delete a history entry via the UI.
- Users can successfully edit a history entry via the UI.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/implementation/3-ui-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
