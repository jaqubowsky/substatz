We're continuing our implementation of Track Subscription Changes by implementing task group number 4:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 4: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** `testing-engineer`
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-3

- [ ] 4.0 Review existing logic and fill critical testing gaps
  - [ ] 4.1 Write focused tests for the new and modified server actions (`updateSubscription`, `getSubscriptionHistory`, `deleteSubscriptionHistory`, `updateSubscriptionHistory`), ensuring they handle valid and invalid cases correctly.
  - [ ] 4.2 Write basic rendering tests for the new UI components (`SubscriptionHistoryView`, `SubscriptionHistoryCard`) to ensure they display data correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All new and modified server actions have sufficient test coverage.
- New UI components pass basic rendering tests.
- Critical user workflows for this feature are covered by tests.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/implementation/4-test-review-gap-analysis-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
