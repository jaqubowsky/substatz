We're continuing our implementation of Track Subscription Changes by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 1: Data Models and Migrations
**Assigned implementer:** `database-engineer`
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Complete database layer
  - [ ] 1.1 Add the `SubscriptionHistory` model to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. It should include fields for `id`, `createdAt`, `changedField`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, and a relation to the `Subscription` model.
  - [ ] 1.2 Create a new Prisma migration to apply the `SubscriptionHistory` table to the database.
  - [ ] 1.3 Verify that the migration runs successfully and the `Subscription` to `SubscriptionHistory` relationship is correctly established.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `SubscriptionHistory` model is correctly defined in the Prisma schema.
- The new migration is generated and applies without errors.
- The relationship between `Subscription` and `SubscriptionHistory` is functional.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

# Task 1: Data Models and Migrations

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-12-track-subscription-changes/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** [Implementation Date]
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | üîÑ In Progress

### Task Description
This task involves creating the database schema and migration for the `SubscriptionHistory` feature.

## Implementation Summary
[High-level overview of the solution implemented - 2-3 short paragraphs explaining the approach taken and why]

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added the `SubscriptionHistory` model and its relation to the `Subscription` model.

### New Files
- `prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_subscription_history/migration.sql` - The new migration file to create the `subscription_histories` table.

## Key Implementation Details

### `SubscriptionHistory` Model
**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

[Detailed explanation of the new model's fields, types, and relations.]

**Rationale:** [Why this approach was chosen]

## Database Changes (if applicable)

### Migrations
- `[timestamp]_add_subscription_history/migration.sql` - Creates the `subscription_histories` table.
  - Added tables: `subscription_histories`
  - Added columns: `id`, `created_at`, `changed_field`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `subscription_id`
  - Added indexes: index on `subscription_id`

### Schema Impact
[Description of how the schema changed and any data implications]
