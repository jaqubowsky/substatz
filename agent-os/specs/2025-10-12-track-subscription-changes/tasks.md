# Task Breakdown: Track Subscription Changes

## Overview
Total Tasks: 16
Assigned roles: `database-engineer`, `server-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, `testing-engineer`

## Task List

### Database Layer

#### Task Group 1: Data Models and Migrations
**Assigned implementer:** `database-engineer`
**Dependencies:** None

- [x] 1.0 Complete database layer
  - [x] 1.1 Add the `SubscriptionHistory` model to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. It should include fields for `id`, `createdAt`, `changedField`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, and a relation to the `Subscription` model.
  - [x] 1.2 Create a new Prisma migration to apply the `SubscriptionHistory` table to the database.
  - [x] 1.3 Verify that the migration runs successfully and the `Subscription` to `SubscriptionHistory` relationship is correctly established.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `SubscriptionHistory` model is correctly defined in the Prisma schema.
- The new migration is generated and applies without errors.
- The relationship between `Subscription` and `SubscriptionHistory` is functional.

### Server-Side Logic

#### Task Group 2: Server Actions
**Assigned implementer:** `server-engineer`
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [x] 2.0 Complete server-side logic
  - [x] 2.1 Modify the existing `updateSubscription` server action in `src/features/dashboard/server/actions/subscription.ts`.
  - [x] 2.2 After a subscription is successfully updated, compare the old and new data to identify which fields have changed.
  - [x] 2.3 For each changed field, create a new `SubscriptionHistory` record in the database.
  - [x] 2.4 Create a new server action `getSubscriptionHistory` that takes a `subscriptionId` and returns all history records for that subscription.
  - [x] 2.5 Create a new server action `deleteSubscriptionHistory` that takes a `historyId` and deletes the corresponding record.
  - [x] 2.6 Create a new server action `updateSubscriptionHistory` that takes a `historyId` and new data to update a specific history record.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Updating a subscription correctly generates history records for all changed fields.
- `getSubscriptionHistory` returns the correct data.
- `deleteSubscriptionHistory` successfully removes a history record.
- `updateSubscriptionHistory` successfully modifies a history record.

### Frontend Components

#### Task Group 3: UI Implementation
**Assigned implementer:** `frontend-engineer`
**Dependencies:** Task Group 2

- [x] 3.0 Complete UI components
  - [x] 3.1 Create a new `SubscriptionHistoryView.tsx` component that will act as a dialog/modal.
  - [x] 3.2 This component should call the `getSubscriptionHistory` server action to fetch and display the history records in a chronological list or timeline format.
  - [x] 3.3 Create a `SubscriptionHistoryCard.tsx` component to render the details of a single history entry.
  - [x] 3.4 Add "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to each `SubscriptionHistoryCard`. The "Delete" button should trigger the `deleteSubscriptionHistory` action (ideally with a confirmation dialog). The "Edit" button should open a form to modify the entry.
  - [x] 3.5 Add a "View History" button to the `SubscriptionCardActions.tsx` component, which will open the `SubscriptionHistoryView` dialog.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The "View History" button correctly opens the history modal.
- The history modal correctly fetches and displays all history records for the subscription.
- Users can successfully delete a history entry via the UI.
- Users can successfully edit a history entry via the UI.

### Testing

#### Task Group 4: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** `testing-engineer`
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-3

- [ ] 4.0 Review existing logic and fill critical testing gaps
  - [ ] 4.1 Write focused tests for the new and modified server actions (`updateSubscription`, `getSubscriptionHistory`, `deleteSubscriptionHistory`, `updateSubscriptionHistory`), ensuring they handle valid and invalid cases correctly.
  - [ ] 4.2 Write basic rendering tests for the new UI components (`SubscriptionHistoryView`, `SubscriptionHistoryCard`) to ensure they display data correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All new and modified server actions have sufficient test coverage.
- New UI components pass basic rendering tests.
- Critical user workflows for this feature are covered by tests.
