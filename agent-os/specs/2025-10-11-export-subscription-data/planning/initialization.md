# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
I would like to implement a feature where we can export our all existing subscription data we've added, this feature should be only after purchasing subscription, it should be allowed to export to excel or pdf where these options should be available to select after modal opens, it should be placed in the settings tab
