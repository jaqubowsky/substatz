# Task 2: Export UI Components

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** frontend-engineer
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task implements the complete frontend UI for the Export Subscription Data feature. This includes creating the Export Modal with date filters and format selection, the Export Data Section component that checks user plan status, integrating these components into the Settings page, and ensuring full accessibility and responsiveness.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation follows a component-based architecture using React client components for interactivity. The Export Modal provides an intuitive interface with preset date range buttons, custom date picker, and format selection. The Export Data Section intelligently handles both free and premium users—redirecting free users to Stripe checkout while allowing premium users to access the export modal.

Both components are built using ShadCN UI primitives and follow established patterns from the SubStatz codebase, including the use of dynamic imports for code splitting, toast notifications for user feedback, and proper loading states. The file download mechanism converts base64 data from the server into downloadable blobs without requiring temporary file storage.

All components are fully responsive using TailwindCSS utilities and implement comprehensive accessibility features including ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader announcements for loading states.

## Key Implementation Details

### Export Modal Component
**Location:** `src/features/settings/components/export-modal.client.tsx`

The modal component manages local state for date range (from/to), selected format (excel/pdf), and exporting status. It provides four preset buttons that automatically set common date ranges: Last 30 days, Last 6 months, This year, and All time. A custom DateRangePicker allows users to select any arbitrary date range.

The format selector uses a ShadCN Select component with icon-enhanced options for Excel and PDF. When the export button is clicked, the component calls `exportSubscriptionsAction` with the selected parameters, shows a loading spinner, and handles the response by either triggering a file download on success or showing an error toast on failure.

The file download mechanism (`triggerDownload` function) converts the base64-encoded file data back to a Uint8Array, creates a Blob with the appropriate MIME type, generates a temporary object URL, programmatically clicks a hidden download link, and then cleans up the URL to prevent memory leaks.

**Rationale:** Using local component state for UI elements keeps the implementation simple while server state is managed by the action. The preset buttons provide quick access to common use cases while the custom picker offers flexibility. Converting base64 to blob client-side allows for immediate downloads without server-side file storage.

### Export Data Section Component
**Location:** `src/features/settings/components/export-data-section.client.tsx`

This component acts as a gateway to the export feature. It receives the user's plan as a prop and conditionally renders different button states and actions based on plan status. For PAID users, clicking the button opens the ExportModal. For FREE users, it triggers `createCheckoutSessionAction` and redirects to Stripe checkout.

The component maintains loading state during the Stripe redirect to prevent duplicate requests. Different icons and button text are shown based on user plan: Download icon with "Export Subscriptions" for premium users, Crown icon with "Upgrade to Export" for free users. The ExportModal is only rendered for paid users to avoid unnecessary JavaScript loading for free users.

**Rationale:** Separating the access control logic into this component keeps the modal focused on export functionality. Using different button variants (default vs outline) provides visual hierarchy. Conditional rendering of the modal reduces bundle size for free users and makes the premium feature distinction clear.

### Settings Page Integration
**Location:** `src/features/settings/components/settings.tsx`

The ExportDataSection is integrated using Next.js dynamic import with the same pattern as other setting components. It's placed in the Account tab after CurrencySettingsForm and before DeleteAccount, providing logical grouping of account-related features. The user's plan is passed from the session data.

**Rationale:** Dynamic import enables code splitting so the export components are only loaded when the Settings page is accessed. The positioning in the Account tab makes sense as it's a data management feature. Using the same CardContent wrapping pattern maintains visual consistency with other settings sections.

### Responsive Design
Both components use TailwindCSS responsive utilities throughout. The modal's DialogContent has `sm:max-w-[550px]` to constrain width on larger screens while remaining full-width on mobile with proper margins. Preset buttons use a 2-column grid on mobile (`grid-cols-2`) and 4-column on desktop (`sm:grid-cols-4`), ensuring they wrap appropriately.

The Export button in the data section is full-width on mobile (`w-full`) but auto-width on larger screens (`sm:w-auto`) for better visual balance. The DateRangePicker component inherently supports touch interactions through the underlying Calendar component.

**Rationale:** Mobile-first responsive design ensures a good experience on all devices. Grid layouts with responsive columns prevent button crowding on small screens. Full-width buttons on mobile are easier to tap while auto-width on desktop looks more polished.

### Accessibility Features
The modal includes proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements: the format Select has `aria-label="Select export format"`, the loading state has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements. The Dialog component from ShadCN UI provides built-in keyboard navigation (Escape to close, focus trapping) and focus management.

All buttons have descriptive text or icons with accompanying text. The loading spinner is accompanied by text ("Generating your export..." and "Exporting...") rather than relying solely on visual indicators. Screen reader users receive proper feedback at each stage of the export process.

**Rationale:** Accessibility is built into the foundation through ShadCN UI but enhanced with explicit ARIA attributes where needed. Loading states must be announced to screen readers to provide equivalent feedback to sighted users. Keyboard navigation allows users to complete the export workflow without a mouse.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Server Components First
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Both export components use the "use client" directive as they require interactivity (state management, button clicks, modal opening/closing). The Settings page itself remains a server component, with export components dynamically imported only when needed. This follows the pattern of using server components by default and client components only when necessary.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Proper separation of server and client concerns.

### TailwindCSS Utility-First Styling
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All styling uses TailwindCSS utility classes exclusively. No custom CSS was written. The components use the `cn()` utility for conditional classes (e.g., disabling button styles during loading). ShadCN UI components provide the base styling with consistent design tokens, extended with utility classes for spacing, sizing, and responsive behavior.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - 100% utility class usage throughout.

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All responsive styling is mobile-first, starting with mobile defaults and adding `sm:` prefixes for larger screens. The preset buttons grid is 2 columns by default and 4 columns on sm+ screens. The export button is full-width on mobile and auto-width on desktop. The modal constrains its max-width on larger screens while remaining responsive on mobile.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Consistent mobile-first approach throughout.

### Comprehensive Accessibility
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation leverages ShadCN UI's built-in accessibility features and enhances them with explicit ARIA attributes. All interactive elements have proper labels, loading states are announced to screen readers via `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`, keyboard navigation works throughout (Tab, Escape), and focus management is handled by the Dialog component. Icons are always accompanied by descriptive text.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Full compliance with accessibility standards.

### Feature-Based Architecture
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All components are organized within `src/features/settings/components/` following the established pattern. Components are properly exported through the index file. The `.client.tsx` naming convention clearly indicates client components. Integration follows the dynamic import pattern used for other setting components like ChangePasswordForm.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Strict adherence to feature-based organization.

### TypeScript Props and Type Safety
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All component props are explicitly typed with TypeScript interfaces (`ExportModalProps`, `ExportDataSectionProps`). The `ExportFormat` type provides type safety for format selection. All imports use proper TypeScript types from `@prisma/client` for `SubscriptionPlan`. No `any` types are used.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Full type safety throughout.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
None - This task only implements UI components that consume the server action created in Task Group 1.

### External Services
- Stripe Checkout - Free users are redirected to Stripe via `createCheckoutSessionAction` when attempting to export

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/features/settings/server/actions` - Imports `exportSubscriptionsAction` for triggering exports
- `@/server/actions/subscription-plan` - Imports `createCheckoutSessionAction` for Stripe redirect
- `@/components/ui/*` - Uses Dialog, Button, Card, Select, and DateRangePicker components
- `@prisma/client` - Imports `SubscriptionPlan` enum for plan checking
- `sonner` - Uses toast notifications for user feedback
- `lucide-react` - Uses icons (Download, Loader2, Crown, FileSpreadsheet, FileText, Calendar)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this stage.

### Limitations
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Description: The file download mechanism uses Blob URLs which have limited support in very old browsers
   - Reason: Modern web API used for client-side file handling
   - Future Consideration: Could add fallback for older browsers if needed, but current implementation covers 95%+ of users

2. **Large Export File Size**
   - Description: Very large exports (thousands of subscriptions) may cause memory issues during base64 to blob conversion
   - Reason: All data is loaded into memory for client-side conversion
   - Future Consideration: Could implement streaming or chunked processing if users report issues, though typical use cases are well within limits

## Performance Considerations
The components are code-split using Next.js dynamic imports, reducing the initial bundle size for pages that don't need export functionality. The ExportModal is only rendered for paid users, avoiding unnecessary JavaScript for free users.

The file download conversion happens in-memory using typed arrays for efficiency. The base64 string is immediately converted and discarded, minimizing memory footprint. Object URLs are properly revoked after download to prevent memory leaks.

Loading states prevent users from triggering multiple simultaneous exports, avoiding server overload and duplicate requests. The modal's state is local, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of parent components.

## Security Considerations
Plan verification happens server-side in the action, ensuring free users cannot bypass client-side checks. The client-side plan check is purely for UX—determining which button to show and whether to render the modal.

File data is transmitted as base64 over HTTPS, ensuring encryption in transit. The download happens entirely client-side, avoiding temporary files on the server. No sensitive data is logged or exposed in error messages.

The Stripe redirect uses the official Stripe Checkout Session API, maintaining PCI compliance. No payment information is handled client-side.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 3** (Test Review & Gap Analysis) depends on this implementation
  - Testing engineers will verify the UI components work as expected
  - Manual testing will include browser testing of export functionality
  - Accessibility testing will verify keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Notes
The implementation is complete and ready for testing in Task Group 3. The components follow all established patterns from the SubStatz codebase and integrate seamlessly with the Settings page.

The choice to use separate components (Export Modal and Export Data Section) rather than a single monolithic component improves maintainability and allows for better code splitting. The modal can potentially be reused in other contexts if needed in the future.

The preset date range buttons significantly improve UX by eliminating the need for manual date selection in common scenarios. The "All time" preset effectively clears the date filter by setting both dates to undefined.

The dynamic import pattern for ExportDataSection matches the existing pattern used for ChangePasswordForm, maintaining consistency across the codebase and enabling optimal code splitting.
