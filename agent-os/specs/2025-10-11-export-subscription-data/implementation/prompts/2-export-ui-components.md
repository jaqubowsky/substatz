We're continuing our implementation of Export Subscription Data by implementing task group number 2:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 2: Export UI Components
**Assigned implementer:** frontend-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [ ] 2.0 Complete export UI components
  - [ ] 2.1 Create Export Modal component
    - Location: `src/features/settings/components/export-modal.client.tsx`
    - Use "use client" directive
    - Props: `open: boolean`, `onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void`, `userPlan: SubscriptionPlan`
    - Reuse Dialog components from `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
    - State: dateRange (from/to), selectedFormat ('excel'|'pdf'), isExporting (boolean)
    - UI sections:
      - Date range preset buttons (Last 30 days, Last 6 months, This year, All time)
      - DateRangePicker component for custom range
      - Format selector (Select dropdown for Excel/PDF)
      - Export button
      - Progress/bar loader shown when isExporting is true
    - Implement preset button logic to set dateRange state
    - Call `exportSubscriptionsAction` on export button click
    - Handle success: trigger file download, show toast, close modal
    - Handle error: show error toast in modal
    - Keyboard navigation and accessibility
  - [ ] 2.2 Create Export Data Section component
    - Location: `src/features/settings/components/export-data-section.client.tsx`
    - Use "use client" directive
    - Props: `userPlan: SubscriptionPlan`
    - Reuse Card components from `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
    - Layout: CardHeader with title "Export Data" and description
    - CardContent with "Export Subscriptions" button
    - State: modal open/closed
    - If user plan is FREE: button calls `createCheckoutSessionAction` for Stripe redirect
    - If user plan is PAID: button opens ExportModal
    - Import and use ExportModal component
    - Use toast for Stripe redirect feedback
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement file download utility
    - Location: `src/features/settings/components/export-modal.client.tsx` (or separate utility)
    - Function to trigger browser download from base64/blob data
    - Generate filename: `substatz-subscriptions-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` or `.pdf`
    - Use current date for filename
    - Handle browser download mechanics
  - [ ] 2.4 Integrate Export Data Section into Settings page
    - Location: `src/features/settings/components/settings.tsx`
    - Import ExportDataSection
    - Add component in Account tab CardContent after CurrencySettingsForm
    - Pass user plan from session: `session.user.plan`
    - Ensure proper spacing and layout
  - [ ] 2.5 Update settings components index
    - Add exports to `src/features/settings/components/index.ts`
    - Export ExportDataSection for use in Settings page
  - [ ] 2.6 Apply responsive styling
    - Ensure modal works on mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+)
    - Date picker should be touch-friendly on mobile
    - Preset buttons should wrap appropriately on small screens
    - Follow existing responsive patterns from Settings page
  - [ ] 2.7 Implement accessibility features
    - Modal keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab navigation)
    - Focus management (focus on modal open, return focus on close)
    - ARIA labels for interactive elements
    - Loading state announced to screen readers
    - Error messages accessible to screen readers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Export Data Section appears below Currency Settings in Account tab
- Free users clicking export button redirects to Stripe checkout
- Premium users clicking export button opens modal
- Modal displays all date range preset options
- Custom date range picker works correctly
- Format selector allows choosing Excel or PDF
- Export button triggers file generation with loading state
- File downloads automatically with correct filename format
- Modal is keyboard navigable and accessible
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
