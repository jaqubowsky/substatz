We're continuing our implementation of Export Subscription Data by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 3: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-2

- [ ] 3.0 Review implementation and add critical tests if needed
  - [ ] 3.1 Review server-side implementation
    - Review export validation schema
    - Review export server action implementation
    - Review file generation utilities
    - Verify premium plan checking logic
  - [ ] 3.2 Review frontend implementation
    - Review Export Modal component
    - Review Export Data Section component
    - Review Settings page integration
    - Verify state management and user interactions
  - [ ] 3.3 Analyze test coverage gaps for export feature
    - Identify critical workflows lacking coverage:
      - Server action with valid date ranges
      - Server action premium plan verification
      - Excel file generation with data
      - PDF file generation with data
      - Modal user interactions (preset selection, format selection)
      - Free user Stripe redirect flow
    - Prioritize end-to-end workflows over unit tests
    - Focus ONLY on this export feature, not entire application
  - [ ] 3.4 Write up to 10 strategic tests maximum (if gaps found)
    - Test server action rejects FREE users
    - Test server action accepts PAID users
    - Test date range filtering logic
    - Test Excel file generation produces valid output
    - Test PDF file generation produces valid output
    - Test modal opens for premium users
    - Test Stripe redirect for free users
    - Test file download triggers correctly
    - Test error handling for invalid date ranges
    - Test empty subscriptions case handling
    - Maximum 10 tests - skip if implementation is straightforward
  - [ ] 3.5 Manual testing checklist
    - As FREE user: verify Stripe redirect works
    - As PAID user: verify modal opens
    - Test each date range preset (Last 30 days, 6 months, This year, All time)
    - Test custom date range selection
    - Test Excel export downloads correctly
    - Test PDF export downloads correctly
    - Test with no subscriptions (error handling)
    - Test modal close/cancel
    - Test keyboard navigation through modal
    - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - [ ] 3.6 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests related to export feature
    - Do NOT run entire application test suite
    - Verify critical workflows pass
    - Document any failing tests or issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Export feature critical workflows are tested
- Premium access control is verified
- File generation produces valid files
- User interactions work as expected
- No more than 10 tests added if implementation is straightforward
- Manual testing confirms all requirements met
- Feature works across different screen sizes

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
