# Task 1: Validation Schema and Server Actions

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-export-subscription-data/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** server-engineer
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task implements the complete server-side export functionality for the Export Subscription Data feature. This includes installing dependencies, creating validation schemas, implementing database query helpers, building Excel and PDF file generation utilities, and creating the export server action with premium plan verification.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation follows a layered approach, starting with schema validation using Zod, then building database queries to filter subscriptions by date range, creating file generation utilities for both Excel and PDF formats, and finally wrapping everything in a server action that verifies premium access and handles errors gracefully.

The solution leverages existing patterns from the SubStatz codebase, including the `privateAction` pattern for authenticated actions, feature-based architecture for code organization, and centralized error handling. The export functionality is designed to work seamlessly with the existing subscription model without requiring any database changes.

All file generation is done server-side and returns base64-encoded data for client-side download, ensuring data security and proper access control. Premium plan verification is enforced at the server action level, preventing free users from accessing the export feature.

## Key Implementation Details

### Export Validation Schema
**Location:** `src/features/settings/schemas/export.ts`

The schema defines the contract for export requests using Zod validation. It accepts three fields: `dateFrom` (nullable Date), `dateTo` (nullable Date), and `format` (enum: 'excel' | 'pdf'). A custom refinement validates that when both dates are provided, the start date must be before the end date.

**Rationale:** Using Zod ensures type safety at both compile-time and runtime. The nullable date fields allow for flexible filtering where users can export all subscriptions or filter by a specific date range. The refinement prevents invalid date ranges from reaching the database layer.

### Filtered Subscriptions Query
**Location:** `src/features/settings/server/db/export.ts`

The `getFilteredSubscriptions` function builds a dynamic Prisma query based on the provided date range. It always filters by userId for security, and conditionally adds startDate filters using `gte` (greater than or equal) and `lte` (less than or equal) operators. Results are ordered by startDate descending, then by name ascending.

**Rationale:** This approach provides flexibility without requiring multiple query functions. The dynamic where clause construction ensures we only add filters when dates are provided, optimizing the query. Using Prisma's type-safe query builder prevents SQL injection and ensures type safety. The `"use cache"` directive enables React's caching for improved performance.

### Excel File Generation
**Location:** `src/features/settings/server/export-utils.ts` (generateExcelFile)

The Excel generation uses the xlsx library to create a workbook with a single worksheet. Subscription data is transformed into an array of objects with user-friendly column names. Column widths are set for optimal readability. Dates are formatted to ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency. The workbook is written to a buffer and converted to base64 for transmission.

**Rationale:** The xlsx library provides robust Excel file generation with support for formatting and styling. Using base64 encoding allows the file data to be transmitted over JSON without binary complications. The column width settings ensure the exported file is immediately readable without manual adjustments.

### PDF File Generation
**Location:** `src/features/settings/server/export-utils.ts` (generatePdfFile)

The PDF generation uses @react-pdf/renderer to create a professional-looking document with a header section and table layout. The document is landscape-oriented to accommodate all columns. A StyleSheet defines consistent formatting with proper spacing, borders, and typography. The PDF is rendered to a blob, converted to an array buffer, then to a base64 string.

**Rationale:** @react-pdf/renderer provides a React-like API for PDF generation, making it familiar to the team. Using React.createElement directly (instead of JSX) avoids the need for additional build configuration. Landscape orientation maximizes column visibility. The table layout with borders and alternating row styling ensures readability.

### Export Server Action
**Location:** `src/features/settings/server/actions/export-subscriptions.ts`

The action uses the `privateAction` pattern, which automatically handles authentication, rate limiting, and error handling. It first verifies the user has a PAID plan, throwing an ActionError if they're on the FREE plan. Then it fetches filtered subscriptions and throws an error if none are found. File generation is wrapped in a try-catch to handle any generation failures gracefully. The return value includes success flag, base64 file data, filename with current date, and MIME type.

**Rationale:** Enforcing premium access at the server action level ensures security regardless of client-side checks. The early validation pattern (plan check, then subscription count) fails fast and provides clear error messages. Try-catch around file generation isolates potential library errors. Returning comprehensive metadata (filename, MIME type) gives the client everything needed to trigger the download.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

### Migrations
None - The feature uses the existing Subscription model without modifications.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Zod Schema-First Validation
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The export schema is defined using Zod with proper type inference and custom refinement for date validation. The schema is used in both the server action (via `.schema()` method) and is exported for potential client-side use. This follows the pattern of defining schemas once and using them throughout the stack.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Full compliance with validation standards.

### Server Actions Error Handling
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The export action uses the `privateAction` pattern which provides automatic Sentry integration and consistent error handling. ActionError is used for expected error cases (no subscriptions, premium required) to provide user-friendly messages. Unexpected errors in file generation are caught and wrapped in ActionError to prevent internal details from leaking to clients.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Follows established error handling patterns throughout the codebase.

### Feature-Based Architecture
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All new files are organized within the `src/features/settings/` directory following the established pattern: schemas in `schemas/`, database queries in `server/db/`, utilities in `server/`, and actions in `server/actions/`. Each layer is properly exported through index files for clean imports.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - Strict adherence to feature-based organization.

### Tech Stack Alignment
**File Reference:** `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation uses TypeScript with strict typing, Prisma ORM for database queries with "use cache" for React caching, Zod for validation, Next.js server actions for the API layer, and follows the server-first approach. All dependencies are npm packages compatible with the Next.js/React ecosystem.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - All technology choices align with the established tech stack.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
- Server Action: `exportSubscriptionsAction` - Exported from `@/features/settings/server/actions`
  - Request format: `{ dateFrom: Date | null, dateTo: Date | null, format: 'excel' | 'pdf' }`
  - Response format: `{ success: true, fileData: string (base64), filename: string, mimeType: string }`

### External Services
None - The implementation uses only npm libraries for file generation without external API calls.

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/lib/prisma` - Database client for querying subscriptions
- `@/lib/safe-action` - Action framework with authentication and error handling
- `@/lib/errorMessages` - Centralized error message definitions
- `@/hooks/get-server-auth` - Server-side authentication (via privateAction)
- `@prisma/client` - Subscription model types and SubscriptionPlan enum

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this stage.

### Limitations
1. **Large Dataset Performance**
   - Description: Exporting thousands of subscriptions may result in large file sizes and longer generation times
   - Reason: All subscriptions are loaded into memory at once for file generation
   - Future Consideration: Could implement pagination or streaming for very large datasets, though typical users are unlikely to have enough subscriptions for this to be an issue

2. **PDF Layout Constraints**
   - Description: PDF export omits Created Date and Updated Date fields to fit in landscape orientation
   - Reason: @react-pdf/renderer table layout has limited space even in landscape mode
   - Future Consideration: Could implement multi-page layouts or smaller fonts if users need all fields in PDF format

## Performance Considerations
The implementation loads all filtered subscriptions into memory for processing, which is acceptable for typical use cases (most users have fewer than 100 subscriptions). File generation is done server-side to protect user data and ensure consistent output regardless of client capabilities. Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33% but is necessary for JSON transmission. For users with many subscriptions, the date range filtering helps limit the dataset size.

Future optimization could include streaming Excel generation or lazy loading for PDF pages if performance becomes an issue, but this is not expected based on typical usage patterns.

## Security Considerations
Premium plan verification is enforced server-side in the action, ensuring free users cannot bypass client-side checks. All database queries filter by userId from the authenticated session, preventing data leakage between users. ActionError is used to avoid exposing internal error details to clients. File generation errors are logged server-side for debugging but return generic error messages to clients. Rate limiting is automatically applied via the privateAction pattern to prevent abuse.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 2** (Export UI Components) depends on this implementation
  - Frontend components will import and use `exportSubscriptionsAction`
  - Export schema types (`ExportSubscriptionInput`) will be used for client-side form validation
  - File data, filename, and MIME type from action response will be used to trigger browser downloads

## Notes
The implementation is complete and ready for frontend integration. The export schema that was already created (`src/features/settings/schemas/export.ts`) was properly integrated into the implementation, demonstrating good collaboration between tasks. The server action returns all necessary data for the client to trigger downloads without requiring the server to generate URLs or store files temporarily.

The choice to use base64 encoding rather than blob URLs or temporary file storage was deliberate to keep the implementation stateless and avoid cleanup concerns. This makes the feature more scalable and easier to deploy across serverless environments.
